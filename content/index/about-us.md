Izzy and Jack met doing student theatre at the University of Nottingham, and the rest is history!
Well, sort of...

Izzy first saw Jack doing an improv comedy show at Sutton Bonington (a "satellite campus" and Izzy's home).
Jack did not see Izzy, and mostly remembers being paid in beer for the gig.
Luckily he made a good impression - he was, quote, "one of the actually funny ones".
When they met properly is the subject of much debate and conjecture, though it definitely involved some kind of 80s music and a now-condemned student theatre.

Subject of less debate and conjecture is how they started going out.
The Nottingham New Theatre hosts an annual, end of year boat party.
This was the last university event Jack was ever going to go to, so like any good student terrified at the prospect of entering the "real world", he got well and truly trollied.
And it was only thanks to this trollying that he was able to overcome his innate awkwardness and ask Izzy out.
Three times.
Fortunately for him, Izzy said yes every time, and again a further one time the next morning when he made it clear he was, in fact, serious.

Skip forward six months and the world is on the brink of a global pandemic.
After 6 months of a relationship, having such a thing forcing you to not just move in with one another but basically be around and under one another's feet for eighteen solid months might be a problem.
But they made it.
And now here we are.

Jack proposed on the 20th of April 2023.
He had ordered the ring from Izzy's favourite jeweller on Instagram some months before, and fully intended (at least he promises) to wait until the right moment - maybe at a Pick Your Own Fruit Farm in North Notts! We will never know for sure what that moment would have looked like because in less than six hours of the ring arriving he was down on one knee.
Izzy proceeded to call him a f***ing idiot three times.
But fortunately for him she did then also say yes.
