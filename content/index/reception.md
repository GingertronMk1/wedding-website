For day guests, we then go to Swancar Farm Country House, where the drinks reception begins at 2:30pm, followed by the wedding breakfast.
The evening party is expected to start at 7:30pm - evening guests get there then.

Swancar is markedly less public transport-friendly than St John's, so if you are not driving yourself we recommend using a [local taxi service](/accommodation#local-taxis).
There is a fair bit of parking available at Swancar if you are driving yourself.
